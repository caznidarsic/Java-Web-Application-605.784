Some of the various technologies used by the project include JavaServer Pages, JavaServer Faces, Enterprise Java Beans, Java Persistence API, JPQL, Hibernate (HQL and Criteria API), Message Driven Beans and JMS, Java Transactions API, Spring Framework, and Spring MVC with the Hibernate Validator API.
